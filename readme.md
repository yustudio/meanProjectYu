## About myself
I have started working on MEAN stack web development since early 2016. 
My first full stack project was actually in 2013 when I built a LAMP stack
for work. The ability to build the components of your own web site has always
facinated and intrigued me. Now here I am using JavaScript and related
frameworks and tools to learn the latest and greatest in web development!

I started learning the MEAN stack from taking online courses from coursera. I picked HongKong University of Technology fulls stack web developer project. I have learned CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, AngularJS, NodeJs, Express and MongoDB. I built a MEAN full stack web application as a completion of this certificate project, which has the most basic features for almost all the applications: user registration, login and view user's profile.

I am learning React and Redux to enhance the organization and functionality of 
my own MEAN project: The Triangle Realty. Stay tuned. The best is yet to come!
